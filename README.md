Based on 2 stepper motors, some compression springs, and limit switches.
It uses some micro and drivers for stepper motors to open press and start
closing the press at some rate until a certain force is met (when aeropress is completely pressed).

It requires four plates to be 3D printed.  And on the BOM there will be:

* 4 compression springs
* 2 stepper motors
* 8 nylon bearings
* 2 lead screws
* 4 smooth rods

In progress.
